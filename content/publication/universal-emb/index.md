abstract: A method and system for learning universal vector representation of concepts in a distributed environment comprising a plurality of edge devices are provided. The method includes obtaining data from one or more sources available at the candidate edge device, determining a plurality of concepts from the obtained data, training on-device artificial intelligence (AI) model locally available at the candidate edge device using the plurality of concepts. The method also includes transmitting the at least one trained on-device AI model to a server and receiving a global AI model for deployment from the server. The method further includes deploying the global AI model for universal vector representation of concepts in the candidate edge device.
