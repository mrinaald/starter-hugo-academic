abstract: "Embodiments herein disclose methods and systems for identifying behavioural trends across users. The system includes electronic devices. The electronic devices include a behavioural recommendation controller. The behavioural recommendation controller is configured to: detect a first plurality of activities performed by a plurality of first users in relation with a plurality of contexts; recognize the first plurality of physical activities in relation with the plurality of contexts for the first user; recognize multiple activities performed using smart devices by the first user during each first physical activity in each context; and recognize a second plurality of physical activities performed by multiple concurrent second users during each context to refer current behavior or new behavior of the users."
