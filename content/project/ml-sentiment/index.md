<h2>Brief summary of the work done in the project</h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li> The project aimed at developing a user application to get time-mapped viewer sentiment while watching a video.</li>
  <li> The application input was the viewer’s webcam feed in real-time while watching the video and the output contained the emotion specified at regular time intervals throughout the duration of the video being watched.</li>
  <li> The following set of six emotions were considered in the application: {Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprised, Fearful}</li>
