<!-- <h2>Details</h2> -->
<!-- This project was started as part of the course CS657: Information Retrieval, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Arnab Bhattacharya, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. It was later continued beyond the course into my second undergraduate research project. -->
<!-- This project was done as part of the course CS731A: Blockchain Technology and Applications, in the Spring ‘19 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Sandeep Shukla, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. -->
<!-- This project was done as an undergraduate project, in the Spring ‘18 term at IIT Kanpur under Prof. Indranil Saha, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur. -->

<h2>Brief summary of the work done in the project</h2>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
  <li>Implemented various algorithms such as Line Following, Object Detection and Object Tracking using OpenCV C++.</li>
  <li>Implemented the Speech Recognition, Chat-bot and the Integration System modules for the project HURO in the SnT Summer Camp 2016.</li>
  <li>Actively worked with team on Computer Vision problem statements required for participation in the competition HuroCup Fira, a robotic game
and robotics benchmark problem for humanoid robots.</li>
  <li>Implemented Histogram Backprojection algorithm using OpenCV for improving object detection in a camera feed.</li>
</ul>
