I am a CSE Graduate from IIT Kanpur, and currently working as a Lead Engineer at Samsung R&D Institute Bangalore (SRI-B), India.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

My broad fields of interest include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Human-Machine Interaction, and Robotics. I have also developed a newfound interest in Federated Learning through my projects at SRI-B, and I am currently exploring this area.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

Before joining SRI-B, I also interned at Hike Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, in the summer of 2017, where I worked towards developing an Image Classifier fine-tuned for classifying between predefined categories of images. Apart from this, I was also a member of the Humanoid Project at the Robotics club of IIT Kanpur, and have contributed towards its Computer Vision modules. Additionally, I have done numerous projects on areas like One-Shot Learning, Real-time Sentiment Analysis, Detecting Semantically Similar Questions, and others. An exhaustively detailed list of my projects can be found in the Projects section.
{style="text-align: justify;"}

In my free time, I love watching movies and TV shows. I also like to read articles related to astrophysics, quantum physics, psychology, and cognitive science. I am also a casual gamer.
